The module allows the calculation of the kinematics of a four lever gear featured with a pivot point eccentricity.

Download the python module and place it in a convenient folder: the same of the calling script or the usual search folder for python.

Import the module, usually at the beginning of the main script

The arguments to be passed are given in the following order: L1, L2, Ix, Iy and e. Where L1 is the first and closest lever to the connection point, 
L2 is the lever attached to the lever L1, Ix and Iy are the coordinates of the connecting point and e is the eccentricity.
